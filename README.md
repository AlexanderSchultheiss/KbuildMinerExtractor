-based Kbuild extractor for KernelHaven

## Capabilities
This extractor finds conditional compilation settings Kbuild files
(Kbuild*, Makefile*).

## License
This extractor is licensed under GPLv3. Another license would be possible with
following restrictions:

The extractor contains `kbuildminer.jar` which is under GPL-3.0. We do not link
against kbuildminer, so technically we are not infected by GPL. However a
release under a license other than GPL-3.0 would require the removal of the
contained undertaker.
